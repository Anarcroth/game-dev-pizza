4. Start the development web server:

`npm run dev`

5. Access your project in the browser:

6. ???

7. Profit!

## TODO
- [ ] Get livereload working with local dev.
- [ ] Setup basic node server boilerplate.
- [ ] Streamline local development setup.
- [ ] Add support for PostCSS to Webpack config.
